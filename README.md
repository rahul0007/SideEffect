This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, Server.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* `/server` is for the Ktor server application.

* `/shared` is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is `commonMain`. If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

# 🚀 Jetpack Compose: Side Effects Demo

This module demonstrates **all major side effect APIs in Jetpack Compose** with examples. It is compatible with **Kotlin Multiplatform (Android/iOS)**.

---




## ✨ What Are Side Effects?

In Compose, **side effects** let you interact with the *outside world* in a way that doesn’t interfere with Compose’s declarative UI system.

✅ Use side effects for:
- Network calls
- Logging
- Showing Toasts
- Managing external resources

## 🛠 Types of Side Effects

| Effect                     | When It Runs                                      | Common Use Case                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **LaunchedEffect**         | On key change or initial composition              | Start coroutine tied to lifecycle    |
| **SideEffect**             | After every successful recomposition & commit     | Sync external state (e.g., analytics)|
| **DisposableEffect**       | On enter/exit of the Composable                   | Setup & cleanup resources            |
| **rememberCoroutineScope** | Coroutine scope for user-triggered actions        | Button click APIs, animations        |
| **rememberUpdatedState**   | Always gives latest value in long-lived effects   | Avoid stale callbacks                |

## 📜 Example Logs
When you click the button:

🟢 SideEffect: After recomposition. Count=1
🟣 LaunchedEffect: Count=1 (starting work)
🔵 rememberCoroutineScope: Coroutine started for count=1
🟣 LaunchedEffect: Count=1 (work done)
✅ rememberUpdatedState: Handling click #1
