This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, Server.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code that‚Äôs common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple‚Äôs CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if you‚Äôre sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* `/server` is for the Ktor server application.

* `/shared` is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is `commonMain`. If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

# üìù What are Side-Effects in Compose?

The purpose of side effects in Jetpack Compose is to allow for the execution of non-UI related operations that change the state of the app outside of a Composable function in a controlled and predictable manner.

Side effects, such as updating a database or making a network call, should be kept separate from the UI rendering logic to improve the performance and maintainability of the code.

Jetpack Compose provides several Composable functions, such as `SideEffect`, `LaunchedEffect,` and` DisposableEffect,` that enable developers to manage side effects effectively, by decoupling them from the UI rendering logic and executing them in a separate coroutine scope.

## üõ† Types of Side Effects

| Effect                     | When It Runs                                      | Common Use Case                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **LaunchedEffect**         | On key change or initial composition              | Start coroutine tied to lifecycle    |
| **SideEffect**             | After every successful recomposition & commit     | Sync external state (e.g., analytics)|
| **DisposableEffect**       | On enter/exit of the Composable                   | Setup & cleanup resources            |
| **rememberCoroutineScope** | Coroutine scope for user-triggered actions        | Button click APIs, animations        |
| **rememberUpdatedState**   | Always gives latest value in long-lived effects   | Avoid stale callbacks                |
